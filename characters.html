                            <h2 class="text-center hidden-xs"><strong>The Patrician | Lord Vetinari</strong></h2>
                            <p class="text-justify">Lord Havelock Vetinari is the Lord Patrician (Primus inter pares) of
                                the city-state of Ankh-Morpork, and is the archetype of a benevolent dictator, in a chilly,
                                inscrutable way. He is by far the most successful incumbent in the position to date, and his
                                dedication to the city (albeit sometimes in unusual ways) means that for the first time anyone
                                can recall, the city “just works”. Although he is generally disliked as much as any of his
                                predecessors, he has managed to arrange things in such a way that things are better with
                                him as Patrician than someone else. Given the peculiarities of previous Patricians, such as
                                Homicidal Lord Winder and Mad Lord Snapcase, Vetinari is unusually normal. An exception to
                                this is his pathological dislike of Mime artists. On rising to power, he immediately banned
                                them from the city, with anyone practicing Mime quickly finding themselves being hung
                                upside down in the palace scorpion pits with “Learn the Words” written on the opposite
                                wall.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">He is described as a somewhat Machiavellian character, although his ideas
                                of administration differ somewhat. He is tall, thin, and dresses entirely in black, as befitting
                                his Assassin’s training. Mustrum Ridcully, Archchancellor of Unseen University, states that he
                                reminds him of a “predatory flamingo”. Lord Vetinari's political philosophy can be summed
                                up by his belief that what people wish for most is not good government, or even justice,
                                but merely for things to stay the same. The Vetinari family motto is, after all, 'Si non
                                confectus, non reficiat' ("If it ain't broke, don't fix it").

                            <p class="text-justify">The Gods of the Discworld (those of note, in any case) live in
                                Dunmanifestin atop the tallest mountain on the Disc, the ten-mile-high spire of Cori
                                Celesti. It is here where they play games with the lives of mortals.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Gods are everywhere on the Discworld, a crucial element of the world's
                                peculiar ecology that gives power to belief and demands resolution to any and all narratives.
                                Gods exist ‘in potentia’ in numbers uncountable, but the moment an event of any note occurs
                                (say, two snails happening to cross at a single point) a god becomes tied to it and begins to
                                manifest in the physical world. Most gods remain small and unknown, but a few come to
                                the notice of humanity, whose belief then shapes and strengthens them until they gather
                                enough power to join the Disc's vast, unwieldy pantheon.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Gods on the Discworld exist as long as people believe in them, and their
                                power grows as their followers increase. This is a philosophy echoing the real-world politics
                                of the power of religion and is most detailed in the novel <em>‘Small Gods’</em>. If people
                                should cease believing in a particular god (say, if the religion becomes more important than
                                faith) the god begins to fade and, eventually, will "die" becoming little more than a faded
                                wispy echo.

                            <p class="text-justify">The History Monks (also known as The Order of Wen the Eternally
                                Surprised), are a Buddhist-like religious sect based in the Valley of Oi Dong in the High
                                Ramtops. Their primary job is to ensure that time unfolds on the Disc as it should, and to
                                see history follows the right track. History being set out in the huge lead-bound History Books
                                (20,000 of them), each ten feet high, with printing small enough to need a magnifying glass
                                to read. "When people say it is written, it is written here."
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">They have a number of methods for moving and storing time, for instance by
                                means of spinning cylinders called procrastinators. Procrastinators look like Tibetan prayer wheels.
                                As people’s perception of time affects its flow on the Disc, the Monks must ensure this does not
                                become a problem by, for example, taking some time from the middle of the ocean ('how much time
                                does a codfish need?') and putting it in a busy Ankh-Morpork workshop with a deadline to meet.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">They also frequently need to enter the world to take a more direct hand in
                                events. It is for this reason that a number of monks have been trained as ninja. Many of them have
                                since been retrained by Lu-Tze, who believes most problems can be sorted out without resorting to
                                martial arts.

                            <p class="text-justify">Claude Maximilian Overton Transpire (CMOT) Dibbler is Ankh-Morpork’s
                                most notorious, and perpetually failing, salesman. His nickname derives from his claims
                                along the lines of "selling this at such a low price that it's cutting me own throat". He’s
                                always involved in whatever new fad might be coming through, be it moving pictures as a
                                producer, or an agent for music-with-rocks-in. He’s very often reasonably successful at the
                                time, but ultimately events conspire against him and he fails.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Dibbler’s default sales angle is being found in or around the city’s
                                Sator Square selling dubious ‘Sausage-Inna-Bun’ products, which can only be said to be made
                                of materials that have been <em>around</em> pigs. Dibbler's sausages taste awful, but with a
                                lot of sizzling onions and persistent price-cutting, Dibbler always manages to make a living
                                by selling them to people that have prevoiusly gotten sick from eating them. This
                                demonstrates that he's actually a very good salesman.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">Suspiciously similar characters appear in several countries, all having a
                                similar name and a nickname which describes self-harm. Several of these Dibbler-like salesmen
                                have been encountered by Rincewind. When Rincewind meets a Dibbler-double, he ponders on the
                                theory that there are only a small number of real people in the world, and the many people you
                                meet are merely duplicates, which is why you seem to meet the same person all across the world.

                            <p class="text-justify">The Librarian is faculty member of Unseen University (UU awards: DThau
                                & Professor in L-Space Studies) and is also a 300-lb male orang-utan. The Librarian appears
                                in almost every Discworld book.
                            </p>
                            <p class="text-justify">He was once a human, but a magical accident in <em>‘The Colour of Magic’</em>
                                turned him into his current form, and events meant that the other wizards never got around to changing
                                him back. Having said this, the Librarian has taken great care to erase every record of him as
                                a human, including references to his original name, to prevent this from ever happening. Although
                                the senior wizards looked very hard for one, there are no rules in the university constitution
                                forbidding an orang-utan from being a member of the college council. All the Librarian ever utters is
                                'oook' or 'eeek', but by now the wizards, and especially Rincewind, are so used to this that they
                                understand the Librarian perfectly. They can even translate the merest 'oook' into full-fledged
                                English sentences.

                            <p class="text-justify">At Unseen University, promotion up through the Eight Levels of Wizardry
                                has traditionally been via a method known as “Dead Men’s Pointy Shoes”, and so makes being
                                a senior wizard a rather precarious affair. Since the coming of Archchancellor Ridcully,
                                however, the power structure has stabilised (mainly because nobody is able to murder him). The
                                fighting changed from magical and murderous, to quarrels and minor insults between faculty
                                members. Everybody is able to come down alive and have a big dinner in relative calm
                                (unless the Bursar is insane for the moment or there is a major magical disturbance in the
                                vicinity).

                            <p class="text-justify"></p>Few faculty members like to teach. They have virtual lectures in a
                                classroom (Room 3B) that does not exist; a happy arrangement mutually understood and
                                respected by Faculty and students alike. The other lecture theatre specifically mentioned
                                in the novels is Room 5B, which has its own issues in that Space and Time have come adrift
                                from each other, and a lecturer walking in might discover he is already there and has started
                                taking a class twenty minutes previously.
