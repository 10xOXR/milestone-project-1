                        <h2 class="text-center hidden-xs">The Patrician | Lord Vetinari</h2>
                        <p class="text-justify">Lord Havelock Vetinari is the Lord Patrician (Primus inter pares) of
                            the city-state of
                            Ankh-Morpork, and is the archetype of a benevolent dictator, in a chilly, inscrutable way.
                            He is by far the most successful incumbent in the position to date, and his dedication to
                            the city (albeit sometimes in unusual ways) means that for the first time anyone can
                            recall, the city “just works”. Although he is generally disliked as much as any of his
                            predecessors, he has managed to arrange things in such a way that things are better with
                            him as Patrician than someone else. Given the peculiarities of previous Patricians, such as
                            Homicidal Lord Winder and Mad Lord Snapcase, Vetinari is unusually normal. An exception to
                            this is his pathological dislike of Mime artists. On rising to power, he immediately banned
                            them from the city, with anyone practicing Mime quickly finding themselves being hung
                            upside down in the palace scorpion pits with “Learn the Words” written on the opposite
                            wall.
                            <br><br>
                            He is described as a somewhat Machiavellian character, although his ideas of administration
                            differ somewhat. He is tall, thin, and dresses entirely in black, as befitting his
                            Assassin’s training. Mustrum Ridcully, Archchancellor of Unseen University, states that he
                            reminds him of a “predatory flamingo”. Lord Vetinari's political philosophy can be summed
                            up by his belief that what people wish for most is not good government, or even justice,
                            but merely for things to stay the same; the Vetinari family motto is, after all, Si non
                            confectus, non reficiat ("If it ain't broke, don't fix it").

                        <p class="text-justify">The Gods of the Discworld (those of note, in any case) live in
                            Dunmanifestin atop the tallest Mountain on the Disc, the ten-mile-high spire of Cori
                            Celesti. It is here where they play games with the lives of mortals.
                            <br><br>
                            Gods are everywhere on the Discworld, a crucial element of the world's peculiar ecology
                            that gives power to belief and demands resolution to any and all narratives. Gods exist ‘in
                            potentia’ in numbers uncountable, but the moment an event of any note occurs (say, two
                            snails happening to cross at a single point) a god becomes tied to it and begins to
                            manifest in the physical world. Most gods remain small and unknown, but a very few come to
                            the notice of humanity, whose belief then shapes and strengthens them until they gather
                            enough power to join the Disc's vast, unwieldy pantheon.
                            <br><br>
                            Gods on the Discworld exist as long as people believe in them and their power grows as
                            their followers increase. This is a philosophy echoing the real-world politics of the power
                            of religion and is most detailed in the novel <em>‘Small Gods’</em>. If people should cease
                            believing in a particular god (say, if the religion becomes more important than faith) the
                            god begins to fade and, eventually, will "die", becoming little more than a faded wispy
                            echo.

                        <p class="text-justify">The History Monks (also known as The Order of Wen the Eternally
                            Surprised), are a Buddhist-like religious sect based in the Valley of Oi Doing in the High
                            Ramtops. Their primary job is to ensure that time unfolds on the Disc as it should, and to
                            see history follows the right track, as set out in the huge lead-bound History Books
                            (20,000 of them), each ten feet high, with printing small enough to need a magnifying glass
                            to read. "When people say it is written—it is written here."
                            <br><br>
                            They have a number of methods for moving and storing time, for example by means of spinning
                            cylinders called procrastinators. Procrastinators look like Tibetan prayer wheels. As
                            people’s
                            perception of time affects its flow on the Disc, the Monks must ensure this does not become
                            a problem by, for example, taking some time from the middle of the ocean ('how much time
                            does a codfish need?') and putting it in a busy Ankh-Morpork workshop with a deadline to
                            meet.
                            <br><br>
                            They also frequently need to enter the world, to take a more direct hand in events. It is
                            for this reason that a number of monks have been trained as ninja. Many of them have since
                            been retrained by Lu-Tze, who believes most problems can be sorted out without resorting to
                            martial arts.

                        <p class="text-justify">LClaude Maximilian Overton Transpire (CMOT) Dibbler is Ankh-Morpork’s
                            most notorious, and perpetually failing, salesman. His nickname derives from his claims
                            along the lines of "selling this at such a low price that it's cutting me own throat". He’s
                            always involved in whatever new fad might be coming through, be it moving pictures as a
                            producer, or an agent for music-with-rocks-in. He’s very often reasonably successful at the
                            time, but ultimately events conspire against him and he ultimately fails.
                            <br><br>
                            Dibbler’s default sales angle is to bring found in or around the city’s Sator Square
                            selling dubious ‘Sausage-Inna-Bun’ products, which can only be said to be made of materials
                            that have been <em>around</em> pigs. Dibbler's sausages taste awful, but with a lot of
                            sizzling
                            onions and persistent price-cutting, Dibbler always manages to make a living by selling
                            these sausages to people who have gotten sick from his sausages before. This demonstrates
                            that he is a very good salesman.
                            <br><br>
                            Suspiciously similar characters appear in several countries all having a similar name and a
                            nickname which describes self-harm. Several of these Dibbler-like salesmen have been
                            encountered by Rincewind. When Rincewind meets a Dibbler-double, he ponders on the theory
                            that there are only a small number of real people in the world, and the many people you
                            meet are merely duplicates, that's why you seem to meet the same person all across the
                            world.

                            almost every Discworld book.

                            He was once a human, but a magical accident in ‘The Colour of Magic’ turned him into his
                            current form, and events meant that the other wizards never got around to changing him
                            back. Having said this, the Librarian has taken great care to erase every record of him as
                            a human, including references to his original name, to prevent this from ever happening.
                            Although the senior wizards looked very hard for one, there are no rules in the university
                            constitution forbidding an orang-utan to be a member of the college council. All the
                            Librarian ever utters is 'oook' or 'eeek', but by now the wizards, and especially
                            Rincewind, are so used to this that they understand the Librarian perfectly. They can even
                            translate the merest 'oook' into full-fledged literary English sentences.

                            has traditionally been via a method known as “dead-men’s pointy shoes”, and so makes being
                            a senior wizard a rather precarious affair. Since the coming of Archchancellor Ridcully,
                            however, the power structure has stabilised because nobody is able to murder him. The
                            fighting changed from magical and murderous to quarrels and minor insults between faculty
                            members. Everybody is able to come down alive and have a big dinner in relative calm,
                            (unless the Bursar is insane for the moment or there is major magical disturbance in the
                            vicinity.)

                            Few faculty members like to teach. They have virtual lectures in a classroom, (Room 3B),
                            that does not exist, a happy arrangement mutually understood and respected by Faculty and
                            students alike. The other lecture theatre specifically mentioned in the chronicles is Room
                            5B, which has its own woes in that Space and Time have come adrift from each other, and a
                            lecturer walking in might discover he is already there and has started taking a class
                            twenty minutes previously.
